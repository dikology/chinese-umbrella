# Chinese Umbrella Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 4, 2026**

## Overview

Chinese Umbrella ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS application collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **None**: We do not collect any personal information that you actively provide.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Anonymous User ID**: A randomly generated identifier stored locally to maintain your app preferences and progress between sessions.
- **Usage Data**: Local tracking of your Chinese learning progress (HSK level, vocabulary mastery percentage) stored only on your device.
- **Device Permissions**: Access to camera and photo library (with your explicit permission) for OCR functionality.

### Information from Third Parties
- **None**: We do not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.

## How We Use Your Information

All data processing occurs locally on your device. We use collected information solely for:

- Providing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality to scan Chinese text
- Maintaining your learning progress and preferences within the app
- Improving the user experience during your learning sessions

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally on your device using iOS Core Data and Keychain services.
- **No Cloud Storage**: We do not transmit, upload, or store any data on external servers.
- **No Data Sharing**: We do not share, sell, or transmit your information to any third parties.
- **Anonymous Processing**: All processing uses anonymous identifiers that cannot be linked to your identity.

## Camera and Photo Library Access

The app requests permission to access your camera and photo library for the following purposes:

- **Camera Access**: To capture photos of Chinese text for real-time OCR processing
- **Photo Library Access**: To select existing photos containing Chinese text for processing

All image processing occurs locally on your device using Apple's Vision framework. Images are not stored, transmitted, or shared.

## Data Retention

- User progress and preferences are retained until you delete the app
- Anonymous user IDs are stored locally and deleted when the app is uninstalled
- No data is retained on any external servers

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information:

- **Access**: You can view your stored data within the app
- **Delete**: Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data
- **Modify**: You can reset your progress through the app's settings
